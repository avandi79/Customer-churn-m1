# Customer Churn Prediction (Machine Learning Project)

This project is a complete end-to-end **customer churn prediction system**, implemented using Python and Scikit-Learn.  
The goal is to identify customers who are likely to stop using a service by analyzing behavioral and demographic attributes.

## Objectives
- Apply supervised learning techniques to a real-world business problem  
- Perform data cleaning, preprocessing and feature engineering  
- Train and compare classification models  
- Evaluate performance using accuracy, recall, precision and ROC-AUC  
- Build a simple and reproducible ML pipeline

## Methods & Tools
- **Python**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy** for data processing  
- **Scikit-Learn** for ML models  
- Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting  
- Train/Test split, Scaling, Hyperparameter tuning  
- Visualization with Matplotlib/Seaborn

## What This Project Demonstrates
- Understanding of classification algorithms  
- Ability to build a real ML workflow from raw data to evaluation  
- Familiarity with data preprocessing and model comparison  
- Skills that serve as a foundation for further work in AI and machine learning

This project is part of my preparation for graduate studies in **Artificial Intelligence**, and represents my transition from software development into applied machine learning.
